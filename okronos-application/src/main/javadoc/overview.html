<h1>General presentation</h1>
<h2>The readme file</h2>
See the README.md file for a general presentation of the tool, the build process and the way of customizations.
<h2>Technical background</h2>
<p>
oKronos is written in java with the help of javafx graphics packages, the spring framework for dependency injection and other external libraries.
</p>
<p>
Any 64 bits modern O.S. can be used.
</p>
<p>
The project uses maven to build the sources and can create a delivery for the Windows systemsS and another for Linux systems.
</p>
<h2>Prerequisites</h2>
<ul>
<li>Basic knowledges on java 11,</li>
<li>Basic knowledges on javafx 11.</li>
<li>Basic knowledges on spring dependency injection.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Project structure</h2>
<ul>
<li>okronos-parent: parent maven projet, contains no code by itself.</li>
<li>okronos-annotations: defines annotations and annotation processors used by the project.</li>
<li>okronos-application: contains the appliation core.</li>
<li>resources: contains graphical resources, tools used to build the application as well as external libraries (javafx).</li>
<li>doc: the user documentation sources and generated files.</li>
</ul>
<h1>General design</h1>
<h2>Instances and spring framework</h2>
The application uses the spring framework to create and wave the links between instances. 
<h2>Scenes and javafx controllers</h2>
<p>
The graphical aspect of the application is handled by the javafx library.
The screens (scenes in javafx terminology) are described with the fxml language into a dedicated file. 
They are associated with a javafx controller named XxxSceneController (Xxx denotes the scene the controller is in charge of)
into the package tz.okronos.scene.
</p>
<p>
Each controller is built by the javafx framwork when the fxml file is read, this is why the controller are instantiated with the
help of builder instances. Builders are singleton spring instances and controllers are prototype instances.
</p>
<h2>Data controllers and data model</h2>
<p>
The data model is managed by some data controllers that handle a part of the model. Each data controller is named
XxxModelController and is located into the package tz.okronos.controller  (Xxx denode the functional part the controller is in charge of, 
by example, the controller that manages the pay time is called PlayTimeSceneController).
</p>
<p>
The XxxModelController is the only class that modify the data model it is in charge of.
Each controller contains an instance of a container class that holds the data as javafx.beans.property wrappers.
The controller exposes the content of the wrapper as read-only objects as spring bean properties (@Bean). These properties can be retrieves
by the other controllers or by the views with the spring mechanism (@Autowired).
</p>
<p>
It is important to notice that the model controller does not contains directly the data but that it holds a container that itself contains the data.
This it done to allow cross reference between controllers and data, i.e if a controller 1 contains the property 1.1, if the controller 2 contains the property 2.1,
then the controller 1 can use the value of the property 2.1 whereas the controller 2 can use the value of the property 1.2.
If the controllers would contain directly the properties, spring will detect a loop between the dependencies and the application would fail to start.
Cross reference between dependencies is discourage, but their is cases where they are functionally necessary. By example the time controller shall know
if we are on a play time (this property is managed by the period controller), and the period controller shall know if the time is running
(this property is managed by the time controller).
<p/>
<p>
The scene controllers can also bind a property with a javafx controls with the help of javafx property binding.
In this way the control will be automatically synchronized with the data.
</p>
<h2>Events</h2>
<p>
The application uses an event bus that helps to reduce the dependencies between classes.
Their is two categories of events. A 'request' event requests some actions. A 'notif' event notifies of some
change.
</p>
<p>
A typical use case is: 1) A scene controller requests some change, by example to stop the play time.
2) The model controller handles the request, here: the PlayTimeModelController. 3) The model 
controller notifies of the change into the data model, here: the time is suspending. 4) The scene controller
reacts to this change, here: it changes the look of the play time clock.
</p>
Here the model controller can be notified of the change by the event, or by the change of the javafx
shared property 'playTimeRunning'. A good practice is to use the event, except when the change can be handled
by the target javafx control thanks to a binding, in that case the use of the binding is encourage.
<p>
<h2>Context</h2>
The class KronoContext contains all data that the controllers shall have in common. It gives access, among other, to:
<ul>
  <li>the configuration properties,</li>
  <li>the event bus.</li>
</ul>
The context contains also some shortcut methods, among other for property access, event sending, and file retrieval.
The context is injected to the controllers by spring framework.
